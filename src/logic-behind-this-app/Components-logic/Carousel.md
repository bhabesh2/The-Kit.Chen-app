The Carousel component is a visually appealing and interactive image carousel that displays a series of images and allows users to navigate through them using navigation buttons or by clicking on dot indicators.

Functionality

Image Slides: The carousel component displays a series of images fetched from the slides array. Each slide contains a URL that points to the corresponding image.

Navigation Buttons: The carousel includes left and right navigation buttons (chevron icons) that allow users to move to the previous or next slide, respectively. The buttons are hidden by default and become visible when the user hovers over the carousel (using the group-hover class from Tailwind CSS).

Dot Indicators: The carousel also includes dot indicators below the images, representing each slide. The active slide is indicated by a filled dot, while the inactive slides have unfilled dots. Users can click on the dot indicators to directly navigate to a specific slide.

Carousel Logic

The carousel uses the useState hook to maintain the currentIndex, which keeps track of the currently displayed slide.

The prevSlide function decrements the currentIndex and ensures the carousel loops back to the last slide when the user reaches the first slide.

The nextSlide function increments the currentIndex and ensures the carousel loops back to the first slide when the user reaches the last slide.

The gotoSlide function allows users to navigate to a specific slide by updating the currentIndex to the selected slide's index.

Styling

The carousel is styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes to create a clean and modern design. The images are displayed with a smooth transition effect when changing slides, giving a visually appealing experience.

The navigation buttons are styled as circular icons with a white background and subtle box shadow to enhance visibility and user interaction.

The dot indicators are styled using the RxDotFilled icon from the 'react-icons/rx' package. The active slide's dot is black, while the inactive dots are gray, providing a visual cue of the current slide.

Overall, the Carousel component offers an attractive and user-friendly way to showcase multiple images with easy navigation controls and dot indicators. It can be used in various parts of the app to present visually engaging content to users.
