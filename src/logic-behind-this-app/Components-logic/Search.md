The provided code represents a React component called Searchbar. It is responsible for rendering a search input field with an associated search icon. This component allows users to search for specific food items based on their category titles. The search functionality filters the list of products and passes the filtered results back to the parent component using the onSearch callback prop.

Features of the Searchbar Component

State Management: The Searchbar component uses the useState hook to manage the state of the search query. The current search query is stored in the searchQuery state.

Search Functionality: The component's handleSearch function is triggered whenever the user types or modifies the search input. It updates the searchQuery state with the current input value and then filters the products array (imported from data/products) based on the search query. The filtering is case-insensitive to provide a more user-friendly search experience.

Callback Prop: The component receives a onSearch prop, which is a callback function passed down from the parent component. Whenever the search query is updated and the filtering is performed, the filtered results are passed back to the parent component using this callback function.

Search UI: The search input field is styled with a rounded border and shadow to give it a modern look. The search icon from the react-icons library (AiOutlineSearch) is displayed alongside the input field.

Overall, the Searchbar component is a simple yet powerful component that enables users to quickly search for food items by category title, enhancing the user experience and providing a user-friendly way to navigate through the available products.
