The provided code sets up a Redux store to manage the cart state for the "Kit.Chen" app. The store uses a cart reducer to handle actions related to adding, removing, and updating item quantities in the cart. Additionally, it utilizes local storage to persist the cart items across page reloads or browser sessions.

Features of the Redux Store
Initial State: The initial state of the store is set to an object with a property cartItems. The cartItems property is initialized with the parsed value of the data stored in the local storage. If there are no items in the local storage, an empty array is set as the initial cart items.

Action Types:

'ADD_TO_CART': This action is dispatched when an item is added to the cart. If the item already exists in the cart, its quantity is increased. Otherwise, a new item with quantity 1 is added to the cart.
'REMOVE_FROM_CART': This action is dispatched when an item is removed from the cart.
'INCREASE_QUANTITY': This action is dispatched when the quantity of an item in the cart is increased.
'DECREASE_QUANTITY': This action is dispatched when the quantity of an item in the cart is decreased. The quantity cannot go below 1.
Action Handlers:

For each action type, the reducer updates the state and saves the updated cart items to the local storage. The reducer returns a new state object with the updated cartItems array.
Local Storage: Whenever the cart items are updated, the new cart items are serialized and stored in the local storage using localStorage.setItem('cartItems', JSON.stringify(updatedCartItems)).

Redux Store Creation: The Redux store is created using createStore from the Redux library, with the cartReducer as the root reducer.

Overall, this Redux store is a crucial part of the "Kit.Chen" app, providing a centralized state management system to handle the cart functionality effectively. With the use of local storage, the app can maintain a consistent user experience, even if the user refreshes the page or leaves and returns to the site later.
