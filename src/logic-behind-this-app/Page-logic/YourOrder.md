The provided code is a React functional component named YourOrder, representing the "Your Order" page of the "Kit.Chen" app. This page displays the items added to the cart, their quantities, total price, and provides options to modify the quantity or remove items from the cart.

Features of the YourOrder Component
Retrieving Cart Items: The YourOrder component uses the useSelector hook from react-redux to retrieve the cart items from the Redux store.

Updating Local Storage: The useEffect hook is used to update the local storage whenever the cartItems state changes. This ensures that the cart items persist even if the user refreshes or leaves the page.

Handling Quantity Increase and Decrease: The component provides buttons for increasing and decreasing the quantity of each item in the cart. These buttons trigger the corresponding handleIncreaseQuantity and handleDecreaseQuantity functions, which dispatch actions to update the quantity in the Redux store.

Removing Items from Cart: The component provides a "Remove" button for each item in the cart. Clicking on this button triggers the handleRemoveItem function, which dispatches an action to remove the item from the Redux store.

Displaying Cart Items: The component maps through the cartItems array and displays each item's details, including its image, title, description, price, and quantity.

Displaying Total Price and Item Count: If there are items in the cart, the component displays the total number of items and the total payable amount based on the quantity and price of each item.

Buy Now Button: If there are items in the cart, a "Buy Now" button is displayed, which could be used to proceed to the checkout or payment process.

Overall, the YourOrder component provides a user-friendly and interactive interface for managing the items added to the cart in the "Kit.Chen" app. It allows users to easily modify the quantity or remove items, view the total price, and proceed to the buying process if they wish to do so.
