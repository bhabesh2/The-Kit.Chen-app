The provided code is a React functional component named Food, representing the Food page of the "Kit.Chen" app. It displays a collection of food items available for ordering. The component includes various sub-components such as Navbar, Searchbar, Card, and Footer to provide a complete layout and functionality for the page.

Features of the Food Component
Searchbar: The Searchbar component is included at the top of the page, allowing users to search for specific food items. It receives a callback function (onSearch) from the parent Food component to update the list of displayed food items based on the search query.

Card Components: The component utilizes the Card component to display individual food items in a responsive grid layout. Each Card represents a food product with its image, title, description, and price. The Card component also has an "Add to Cart" button that triggers the handleAddToCart function when clicked.

Filtered Products: The Food component maintains a state filteredProducts that holds the list of food items to be displayed. Initially, it is set to the entire products data array. However, when a user enters a search query in the Searchbar, the list is filtered based on the query and updated in the state.

Add to Cart: The handleAddToCart function dispatches an action to the Redux store to add the selected food item to the cart. It takes the selected product as a parameter and sends the corresponding action with the payload to the store.

Navbar and Footer: The Navbar component is included at the top of the page to provide navigation links to other pages of the app. The Footer component is placed at the bottom, displaying additional information and social media links.

Overall, the Food component provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for exploring and ordering various food items available in the "Kit.Chen" app. The combination of search functionality, responsive grid layout, and integration with the Redux store for cart management ensures a smooth and delightful user experience.
